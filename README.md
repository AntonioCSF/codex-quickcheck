# Codex-quickcheck

*Codex-quickcheck* is a thin wrapper over the Haskell QuickCheck library
to write property-based tests for programming exercises in the 
[Codex system](https://github.com/pbv/codex).

It may, however, be used independently of the Codex system; see the
`examples` directory for some use examples.
